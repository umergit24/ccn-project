Let’s deploy our first app on Kubernetes.

```linux
nano deployment.yaml
```

This will create a YAML file for us where we can add the definitions for deployments as well as service which will be needed in the next task. The deployment and service definitions are separated using "---".

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: pythonapp-deploy
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: pythonapp
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: pythonapp
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: flask-test-app
          image: docker.io/ukhan2003/pythonapp_image
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3000
---

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: pythonapp-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: pythonapp
  ports:
    - protocol: "TCP"
      port: 6000
      targetPort: 3000
  type: LoadBalancer

```


```kubectl
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```
